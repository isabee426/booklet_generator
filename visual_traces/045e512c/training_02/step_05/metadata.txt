Description:
Building on Step 4, replicate the surrounding shapes in the output grid, ensuring they match the colors of the shapes next to them you just replicated. Maintain the same spacing of the first replicated shape to the reference shape and ensure the orientation of each replicated shape aligns with that of the original. Sometimes a shape may be cut off by the border of the grid.
