Description:
Building on Step 2, take each 3x3 cell in the output grid and fill it with the corresponding 3x3 section from the original input grid. This means that for every enlarged cell in the output, you will directly paste the original 3x3 input without any modifications. Ensure that each section aligns correctly to maintain the overall structure of the grid.
