STEP 1 — Individual example analyses

Important common facts for all examples: each input is 3×3 and each output is 9×9. Colors seen across the examples are only from the set [0,2,4,6,7] where 0 is background (black) and 2,4,6,7 are the colored objects. In every example the transformation is a geometric scaling: each input cell is expanded into a 3×3 block of the same color in the output.

Example 1 (first input → first output)
- Input objects: color 6 pixels (magenta) arranged in a small hooked/C-like shape on a black (color 0) 3×3 canvas.
- Output objects: color 6 forms the same hooked/C-like shape but scaled up and rendered on a 9×9 black background.
- What changed: each color 6 pixel in the 3×3 input became a 3×3 contiguous block of color 6 in the 9×9 output. No new colors were introduced and no color pixels changed identity.
- What stayed the same: the relative shape/arrangement of the colored pixels is preserved, and the background remains color 0. The output dimension increased from 3×3 → 9×9.
- Why it changed this way: the transformation maps every input cell to a 3×3 block in the output, so the small shape is reproduced at 3× scale without changing colors.

Example 2 (second input → second output)
- Input objects: color 4 pixels (yellow) in a sparse arrangement on a black 3×3 canvas (a small pattern of isolated yellow cells).
- Output objects: color 4 appears in the 9×9 output as larger 3×3 yellow blocks at positions corresponding to the original yellow cells.
- What changed: each original color 4 pixel was expanded to a 3×3 block of color 4. No pixels changed color or were merged with other colors.
- What stayed the same: the pattern of which input cells were colored vs background is preserved, only scaled. The background remains color 0.
- Why: same rule — each 3×3 input cell becomes a 3×3 block in the output, preserving the pattern.

Example 3 (third input → third output)
- Input objects: color 2 pixels (red) arranged as short vertical and horizontal bars on the 3×3 input.
- Output objects: color 2 appears as corresponding larger bars in the 9×9 output (each input pixel replaced by a 3×3 red block).
- What changed/stayed same & why: identical reasoning — geometric upscaling by factor 3 with preservation of color and relative layout.

Example 4 (fourth input → fourth output)
- Input objects: color 2 pixels (red) arranged as horizontal bars in the 3×3 cell.
- Output objects: those bars are reproduced at 3× scale (3×3 blocks) in the 9×9 output.
- Change/stay/why: same scaling rule as above.

Example 5 (fifth input → fifth output)
- Input objects: color 7 pixels (light blue) arranged in a small shape on the 3×3 canvas.
- Output objects: color 7 forms the same shape scaled into 3×3 blocks on the 9×9 background.
- Change/stay/why: again, each input cell → 3×3 region of the same color.

STEP 2 — Compare across examples

INPUTS — common vs different
- Same in all inputs: all are 3×3 grids, use only colors {0 plus one nonzero color per example}, and contain small shapes made of one nonzero color on a black (color 0) background.
- Different between inputs: the nonzero color and the particular pixel pattern vary (example-to-example the colored pixels occupy different cells and the active color changes between 2,4,6,7).
- Why consistent: the rule applies equally regardless of which of the allowed nonzero colors is present or where its pixels lie.

OUTPUTS — common vs different
- Same in all outputs: all are 9×9, background is still color 0, and every colored input pixel becomes a filled 3×3 block of the same color in the corresponding scaled position.
- Different: which color appears and where depends on the input pattern.
- Why consistent: a uniform scaling transform is applied to every example.

STEP 3 — Transformation by color

- Color 0 (background): stays background. In the 9×9 output, input background cells become 3×3 background blocks. The background is preserved and simply fills more cells because the grid is scaled.
- Color 2 (red): each color 2 pixel in the 3×3 input is replaced by a 3×3 contiguous block of color 2 in the output at the scaled coordinates.
- Color 4 (yellow): same as color 2 — expanded to 3×3 blocks, preserving pattern.
- Color 6 (magenta): same behavior — each pixel becomes a 3×3 magenta block.
- Color 7 (light blue): same behavior — scaled to 3×3 blocks.

Which colors are affected: all nonzero colors {2,4,6,7} are scaled in identical fashion. Which colors stay the same: color identities remain unchanged (no recoloring). No color interactions occur — colors do not mix or replace each other; they are simply enlarged in place.

Causal reasoning: The purpose is to produce a larger canvas that preserves the original pattern while scaling it uniformly so each original cell maps to a 3×3 tile. This preserves topology and relative positions while enlarging the pattern for easier visual recognition or tiling.

STEP 4 — Grid size pattern

- Relationship: outputs are 3× larger in each dimension (3 → 9). Equivalently, each dimension is multiplied by 3.
- Are outputs same size? No, outputs are larger.
- Why necessary: the rule maps each single input cell to a 3×3 block in the output; thus the full 3×3 input becomes 9×9.
- Purpose: to create space for the enlarged representation of each input cell and preserve the input pattern at a higher resolution.

STEP 5 — General transformation pattern (summary, with WHY)

The transformation uniformly scales the 3×3 input by a factor of 3 in each direction, producing a 9×9 output: every input cell (whether color 0,2,4,6 or 7) is replaced by a 3×3 block of the same color at coordinates (3r .. 3r+2, 3c .. 3c+2). This preserves the original pattern shape and color identity while enlarging it. The rule applies to any of the nonzero colors (2, 4, 6, 7) and leaves color 0 as background, so the output is a faithful 3×-scaled version of the input for visualization or tiling purposes.
