  "phase1_analysis": "STEP 1 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Individual example analyses\n\nImportant common facts for all examples: each input is 3\u00c3\u20143 and each output is 9\u00c3\u20149. Colors seen across the examples are only from the set [0,2,4,6,7] where 0 is background (black) and 2,4,6,7 are the colored objects. In every example the transformation is a geometric scaling: each input cell is expanded into a 3\u00c3\u20143 block of the same color in the output.\n\nExample 1 (first input \u00e2\u2020\u2019 first output)\n- Input objects: color 6 pixels (magenta) arranged in a small hooked/C-like shape on a black (color 0) 3\u00c3\u20143 canvas.\n- Output objects: color 6 forms the same hooked/C-like shape but scaled up and rendered on a 9\u00c3\u20149 black background.\n- What changed: each color 6 pixel in the 3\u00c3\u20143 input became a 3\u00c3\u20143 contiguous block of color 6 in the 9\u00c3\u20149 output. No new colors were introduced and no color pixels changed identity.\n- What stayed the same: the relative shape/arrangement of the colored pixels is preserved, and the background remains color 0. The output dimension increased from 3\u00c3\u20143 \u00e2\u2020\u2019 9\u00c3\u20149.\n- Why it changed this way: the transformation maps every input cell to a 3\u00c3\u20143 block in the output, so the small shape is reproduced at 3\u00c3\u2014 scale without changing colors.\n\nExample 2 (second input \u00e2\u2020\u2019 second output)\n- Input objects: color 4 pixels (yellow) in a sparse arrangement on a black 3\u00c3\u20143 canvas (a small pattern of isolated yellow cells).\n- Output objects: color 4 appears in the 9\u00c3\u20149 output as larger 3\u00c3\u20143 yellow blocks at positions corresponding to the original yellow cells.\n- What changed: each original color 4 pixel was expanded to a 3\u00c3\u20143 block of color 4. No pixels changed color or were merged with other colors.\n- What stayed the same: the pattern of which input cells were colored vs background is preserved, only scaled. The background remains color 0.\n- Why: same rule \u00e2\u20ac\u201d each 3\u00c3\u20143 input cell becomes a 3\u00c3\u20143 block in the output, preserving the pattern.\n\nExample 3 (third input \u00e2\u2020\u2019 third output)\n- Input objects: color 2 pixels (red) arranged as short vertical and horizontal bars on the 3\u00c3\u20143 input.\n- Output objects: color 2 appears as corresponding larger bars in the 9\u00c3\u20149 output (each input pixel replaced by a 3\u00c3\u20143 red block).\n- What changed/stayed same & why: identical reasoning \u00e2\u20ac\u201d geometric upscaling by factor 3 with preservation of color and relative layout.\n\nExample 4 (fourth input \u00e2\u2020\u2019 fourth output)\n- Input objects: color 2 pixels (red) arranged as horizontal bars in the 3\u00c3\u20143 cell.\n- Output objects: those bars are reproduced at 3\u00c3\u2014 scale (3\u00c3\u20143 blocks) in the 9\u00c3\u20149 output.\n- Change/stay/why: same scaling rule as above.\n\nExample 5 (fifth input \u00e2\u2020\u2019 fifth output)\n- Input objects: color 7 pixels (light blue) arranged in a small shape on the 3\u00c3\u20143 canvas.\n- Output objects: color 7 forms the same shape scaled into 3\u00c3\u20143 blocks on the 9\u00c3\u20149 background.\n- Change/stay/why: again, each input cell \u00e2\u2020\u2019 3\u00c3\u20143 region of the same color.\n\nSTEP 2 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Compare across examples\n\nINPUTS \u00e2\u20ac\u201d common vs different\n- Same in all inputs: all are 3\u00c3\u20143 grids, use only colors {0 plus one nonzero color per example}, and contain small shapes made of one nonzero color on a black (color 0) background.\n- Different between inputs: the nonzero color and the particular pixel pattern vary (example-to-example the colored pixels occupy different cells and the active color changes between 2,4,6,7).\n- Why consistent: the rule applies equally regardless of which of the allowed nonzero colors is present or where its pixels lie.\n\nOUTPUTS \u00e2\u20ac\u201d common vs different\n- Same in all outputs: all are 9\u00c3\u20149, background is still color 0, and every colored input pixel becomes a filled 3\u00c3\u20143 block of the same color in the corresponding scaled position.\n- Different: which color appears and where depends on the input pattern.\n- Why consistent: a uniform scaling transform is applied to every example.\n\nSTEP 3 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Transformation by color\n\n- Color 0 (background): stays background. In the 9\u00c3\u20149 output, input background cells become 3\u00c3\u20143 background blocks. The background is preserved and simply fills more cells because the grid is scaled.\n- Color 2 (red): each color 2 pixel in the 3\u00c3\u20143 input is replaced by a 3\u00c3\u20143 contiguous block of color 2 in the output at the scaled coordinates.\n- Color 4 (yellow): same as color 2 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d expanded to 3\u00c3\u20143 blocks, preserving pattern.\n- Color 6 (magenta): same behavior \u00e2\u20ac\u201d each pixel becomes a 3\u00c3\u20143 magenta block.\n- Color 7 (light blue): same behavior \u00e2\u20ac\u201d scaled to 3\u00c3\u20143 blocks.\n\nWhich colors are affected: all nonzero colors {2,4,6,7} are scaled in identical fashion. Which colors stay the same: color identities remain unchanged (no recoloring). No color interactions occur \u00e2\u20ac\u201d colors do not mix or replace each other; they are simply enlarged in place.\n\nCausal reasoning: The purpose is to produce a larger canvas that preserves the original pattern while scaling it uniformly so each original cell maps to a 3\u00c3\u20143 tile. This preserves topology and relative positions while enlarging the pattern for easier visual recognition or tiling.\n\nSTEP 4 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Grid size pattern\n\n- Relationship: outputs are 3\u00c3\u2014 larger in each dimension (3 \u00e2\u2020\u2019 9). Equivalently, each dimension is multiplied by 3.\n- Are outputs same size? No, outputs are larger.\n- Why necessary: the rule maps each single input cell to a 3\u00c3\u20143 block in the output; thus the full 3\u00c3\u20143 input becomes 9\u00c3\u20149.\n- Purpose: to create space for the enlarged representation of each input cell and preserve the input pattern at a higher resolution.\n\nSTEP 5 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d General transformation pattern (summary, with WHY)\n\nThe transformation uniformly scales the 3\u00c3\u20143 input by a factor of 3 in each direction, producing a 9\u00c3\u20149 output: every input cell (whether color 0,2,4,6 or 7) is replaced by a 3\u00c3\u20143 block of the same color at coordinates (3r .. 3r+2, 3c .. 3c+2). This preserves the original pattern shape and color identity while enlarging it. The rule applies to any of the nonzero colors (2, 4, 6, 7) and leaves color 0 as background, so the output is a faithful 3\u00c3\u2014-scaled version of the input for visualization or tiling purposes.",

First an empty 9\u00d79 background is created, then every input cell is expanded into a corresponding 3\u00d73 block of the same color, and finally any 3\u00d73 block that corresponds to a nonzero input cell is replaced by a copy of the original 3\u00d73 input pattern recolored so foreground pixels use the block's color and zeros remain background.\n\nSTEP-BY-STEP PATTERN:\n\nStep 1: FILL - Create/initialize the output as an empty background grid (color 0, 9\u00d79, rows 1-9, cols 1-9).\n\nStep 2: EXPAND - For each input cell (color X, 1\u00d71, row r, col c) expand it into a corresponding 3\u00d73 output block (color X, 3\u00d73, rows 3r..3r+2, cols 3c..3c+2) and fill that block with X (if X=0 the block is all background). (Apply this for every input cell; if no such cell exists, do nothing.)\n\nStep 3: FILL - For each 3\u00d73 output block that was created from a nonzero input cell (color X, 3\u00d73, rows 3r..3r+2, cols 3c..3c+2) replace that entire 3\u00d73 block with the original 3\u00d73 input pattern as follows: for each position (i,j) in the original input (i=1..3, j=1..3) set the block cell at (row 3r + (i-1), col 3c + (j-1)) to X if the original input at (i,j) is nonzero, otherwise set it to 0. (If no nonzero blocks exist, do nothing.)\n\nNotes/conditions:\n- Steps refer to \"each input cell\" and \"each nonzero block\" so they are applied repeatedly for all cells/blocks in every example.\n- Color identities are preserved: the recoloring in Step 3 uses the block's color X for all foreground pixels copied from the input pattern; background stays color 0.",
