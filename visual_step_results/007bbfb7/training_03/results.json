  "phase1_analysis": "STEP 1 \u2014 ANALYZE EACH EXAMPLE INDIVIDUALLY\n\nNotes about format below: I use \"color X\" exactly as requested and only use colors from the allowed set [0,2,4,6,7]. Coordinates are given as (row, column) with 0-based indexing inside the 3\u00d73 input.\n\nExample 1 (input \u2192 output)\n- Input objects:\n  - color 6 object occupying multiple cells in the 3\u00d73 input (a connected shape). Visually the filled input cells are at (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2).\n  - background color 0 elsewhere.\n- Output objects:\n  - color 6 appears as large blocks: each input color\u20116 cell is replaced by a 3\u00d73 block of color 6 in the 9\u00d79 output. The 3\u00d73 blocks are placed so that the block corresponding to input cell (r,c) occupies rows 3r..3r+2 and columns 3c..3c+2 in the output.\n  - background color 0 fills the rest.\n- What changed / stayed the same:\n  - Changed: overall grid grew from 3\u00d73 to 9\u00d79; small color-6 pixels became 3\u00d73 pixel blocks.\n  - Stayed the same: relative pattern and adjacency of the color-6 shape; background color 0 remains unchanged.\n- Why this change:\n  - The input is scaled by a factor of 3 in each dimension. Each input cell is expanded into a 3\u00d73 block of the same color, preserving the shape but increasing resolution.\n\nExample 2 (input \u2192 output)\n- Input objects:\n  - color 4 objects occupy some cells of the 3\u00d73 input (several isolated/sparse cells).\n  - background color 0 elsewhere.\n- Output objects:\n  - color 4 is present as 3\u00d73 blocks in the 9\u00d79 output at positions corresponding to the input color\u20114 cells (block for (r,c) at rows 3r..3r+2, cols 3c..3c+2).\n  - background color 0 everywhere else.\n- What changed / stayed the same:\n  - Changed: grid expanded to 9\u00d79; each individual color\u20114 input cell became a 3\u00d73 filled square.\n  - Stayed the same: relative placement of the color\u20114 pattern (same shape when observed at coarse scale).\n- Why this change:\n  - Same scaling rule: every input cell is replaced by a 3\u00d73 tile of the same color.\n\nExample 3 (input \u2192 output)\n- Input objects:\n  - color 2 objects occupying certain cells in the 3\u00d73 input (a small pattern of vertical/horizontal bars).\n  - background color 0 elsewhere.\n- Output objects:\n  - color 2 appears as corresponding 3\u00d73 blocks tiled in the 9\u00d79 output, matching the positions of the input color\u20112 cells.\n  - background color 0 fills the remainder.\n- What changed / stayed the same:\n  - Changed: size increased; pixel blocks enlarged (each color\u20112 pixel \u2192 3\u00d73 block).\n  - Stayed the same: pattern and relative relationships of color\u20112 cells.\n- Why this change:\n  - Again, a uniform 3\u00d7 scaling of every cell.\n\n(Examples 4 and 5 follow the same pattern: each input contains either color 2 or color 7 shapes on a 3\u00d73 grid; in the 9\u00d79 output every input cell of a nonzero color is converted into a 3\u00d73 block of that same color, background 0 stays 0.)\n\nSTEP 2 \u2014 COMPARE ACROSS EXAMPLES\n\nInputs \u2014 common vs different\n- SAME in all inputs:\n  - All inputs are 3\u00d73 grids.\n  - All inputs use background color 0 plus one other nonzero color (one color per example: color 6, color 4, color 2, color 2, color 7 across examples).\n  - The nonzero cells form a small pattern (connected or a small set of cells).\n- DIFFERENT:\n  - Which nonzero color is used differs between examples.\n  - The positions (which cells are filled) differ between inputs.\n- Why consistent:\n  - The rule is position-wise and color-preserving, so it applies regardless of which color or exact cell configuration the input has.\n\nOutputs \u2014 common vs different\n- SAME in all outputs:\n  - All outputs are 9\u00d79 grids.\n  - Background color 0 remains background.\n  - Each nonzero input cell is replaced by a filled 3\u00d73 block of the same color at the corresponding scaled location.\n- DIFFERENT:\n  - Which color appears and the arrangement of blocks depends on the input pattern (so the outputs differ in pattern and color).\n- Why consistent:\n  - The transformation is a uniform scale-by-3 mapping applied to every example identically.\n\nSTEP 3 \u2014 IDENTIFY THE TRANSFORMATION PATTERNS (by color)\n\n- Color 0 (background):\n  - Stays background in outputs. Areas that were 0 in the input become 3\u00d73 blocks of 0 in the output. In effect, background is preserved when the grid is scaled.\n  - Reason: scaling is applied to each cell uniformly; 0 is just another cell value and remains 0.\n\n- Color 2:\n  - Every input cell of color 2 becomes a contiguous 3\u00d73 region of color 2 in the output, positioned at rows 3r..3r+2 and cols 3c..3c+2 for input cell (r,c).\n  - Reason: color-preserving scaling rule; color 2 is not changed or merged with other colors.\n\n- Color 4:\n  - Same behavior as color 2: each color\u20114 input pixel expands to a 3\u00d73 filled block of color 4.\n  - Reason: identical scaling rule applies for color 4.\n\n- Color 6:\n  - Same behavior: each color\u20116 input pixel expands to a 3\u00d73 filled block of color 6.\n  - Reason: uniform per-cell expansion.\n\n- Color 7:\n  - Same as above: input color\u20117 pixels become 3\u00d73 color\u20117 blocks.\n  - Reason: consistent per-cell mapping.\n\nWhich colors are affected and why:\n- All nonzero colors that appear in the inputs are affected in exactly the same way: they are expanded from one cell to a 3\u00d73 block. No color interacts with another; colors are preserved independently. The rule is color-agnostic except that it duplicates the cell\u2019s value into a 3\u00d73 tile.\n\nCausal/goal reasoning:\n- Purpose: enlarge the input pattern while preserving its shape and color relationships, effectively increasing resolution by a factor of 3 in each dimension.\n- Logic: each input cell must map to a 3\u00d73 output region so that the coarse 3\u00d73 pattern becomes a fine 9\u00d79 pattern preserving adjacency and shape at a larger scale.\n\nSTEP 4 \u2014 GRID SIZE PATTERN (given sizes)\n\n- Relationship:\n  - Inputs: all 3\u00d73.\n  - Outputs: all 9\u00d79.\n  - The output grid is larger by a factor of 3 along each axis (9 = 3 \u00d7 input dimension).\n- Why:\n  - Because each input cell is expanded into a 3\u00d73 block, the width and height triple.\n- Purpose:\n  - Creating space to represent each input cell as a small tile replicating that cell\u2019s color over a 3\u00d73 area; this preserves the coarse pattern but increases resolution.\n\nSTEP 5 \u2014 SUMMARY OF THE GENERAL TRANSFORMATION PATTERN (3\u20135 sentences with WHY)\n\nThe transformation uniformly scales the input grid by a factor of 3 in each dimension: every input cell (background or nonzero) is replaced by a 3\u00d73 block of the same color in the 9\u00d79 output. Thus color 0 remains the background, and color 2, color 4, color 6, and color 7 each get expanded from single cells into corresponding 3\u00d73 filled tiles. This color-preserving, position-preserving expansion preserves the original pattern\u2019s adjacency and shape while increasing resolution, so the output is a faithful 3\u00d73 tiling of each input cell (i.e., a scaled-up version of the original 3\u00d73 pattern).\n\n(There is no variable-step behavior \u2014 the same single rule is applied uniformly across all examples.)",

Step 1 created the empty 9\u00d79 structure; the next simple pedagogical step is to replicate each input cell's value into its corresponding 3\u00d73 block (0 \u2192 block of 0s, 2 \u2192 block of 2s). This demonstrates the basic cell-to-block mapping clearly and is a minimal change from the empty 9\u00d79 grid.\n\nDescription:\nEXPAND: Take each cell from the 3\u00d73 input and replicate its VALUE into a 3\u00d73 block in the 9\u00d79 grid.
