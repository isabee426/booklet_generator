  "phase1_analysis": "STEP 1 \u2014 Individual example analyses\n\nImportant common facts for all examples: each input is 3\u00d73 and each output is 9\u00d79. Colors seen across the examples are only from the set [0,2,4,6,7] where 0 is background (black) and 2,4,6,7 are the colored objects. In every example the transformation is a geometric scaling: each input cell is expanded into a 3\u00d73 block of the same color in the output.\n\nExample 1 (first input \u2192 first output)\n- Input objects: color 6 pixels (magenta) arranged in a small hooked/C-like shape on a black (color 0) 3\u00d73 canvas.\n- Output objects: color 6 forms the same hooked/C-like shape but scaled up and rendered on a 9\u00d79 black background.\n- What changed: each color 6 pixel in the 3\u00d73 input became a 3\u00d73 contiguous block of color 6 in the 9\u00d79 output. No new colors were introduced and no color pixels changed identity.\n- What stayed the same: the relative shape/arrangement of the colored pixels is preserved, and the background remains color 0. The output dimension increased from 3\u00d73 \u2192 9\u00d79.\n- Why it changed this way: the transformation maps every input cell to a 3\u00d73 block in the output, so the small shape is reproduced at 3\u00d7 scale without changing colors.\n\nExample 2 (second input \u2192 second output)\n- Input objects: color 4 pixels (yellow) in a sparse arrangement on a black 3\u00d73 canvas (a small pattern of isolated yellow cells).\n- Output objects: color 4 appears in the 9\u00d79 output as larger 3\u00d73 yellow blocks at positions corresponding to the original yellow cells.\n- What changed: each original color 4 pixel was expanded to a 3\u00d73 block of color 4. No pixels changed color or were merged with other colors.\n- What stayed the same: the pattern of which input cells were colored vs background is preserved, only scaled. The background remains color 0.\n- Why: same rule \u2014 each 3\u00d73 input cell becomes a 3\u00d73 block in the output, preserving the pattern.\n\nExample 3 (third input \u2192 third output)\n- Input objects: color 2 pixels (red) arranged as short vertical and horizontal bars on the 3\u00d73 input.\n- Output objects: color 2 appears as corresponding larger bars in the 9\u00d79 output (each input pixel replaced by a 3\u00d73 red block).\n- What changed/stayed same & why: identical reasoning \u2014 geometric upscaling by factor 3 with preservation of color and relative layout.\n\nExample 4 (fourth input \u2192 fourth output)\n- Input objects: color 2 pixels (red) arranged as horizontal bars in the 3\u00d73 cell.\n- Output objects: those bars are reproduced at 3\u00d7 scale (3\u00d73 blocks) in the 9\u00d79 output.\n- Change/stay/why: same scaling rule as above.\n\nExample 5 (fifth input \u2192 fifth output)\n- Input objects: color 7 pixels (light blue) arranged in a small shape on the 3\u00d73 canvas.\n- Output objects: color 7 forms the same shape scaled into 3\u00d73 blocks on the 9\u00d79 background.\n- Change/stay/why: again, each input cell \u2192 3\u00d73 region of the same color.\n\nSTEP 2 \u2014 Compare across examples\n\nINPUTS \u2014 common vs different\n- Same in all inputs: all are 3\u00d73 grids, use only colors {0 plus one nonzero color per example}, and contain small shapes made of one nonzero color on a black (color 0) background.\n- Different between inputs: the nonzero color and the particular pixel pattern vary (example-to-example the colored pixels occupy different cells and the active color changes between 2,4,6,7).\n- Why consistent: the rule applies equally regardless of which of the allowed nonzero colors is present or where its pixels lie.\n\nOUTPUTS \u2014 common vs different\n- Same in all outputs: all are 9\u00d79, background is still color 0, and every colored input pixel becomes a filled 3\u00d73 block of the same color in the corresponding scaled position.\n- Different: which color appears and where depends on the input pattern.\n- Why consistent: a uniform scaling transform is applied to every example.\n\nSTEP 3 \u2014 Transformation by color\n\n- Color 0 (background): stays background. In the 9\u00d79 output, input background cells become 3\u00d73 background blocks. The background is preserved and simply fills more cells because the grid is scaled.\n- Color 2 (red): each color 2 pixel in the 3\u00d73 input is replaced by a 3\u00d73 contiguous block of color 2 in the output at the scaled coordinates.\n- Color 4 (yellow): same as color 2 \u2014 expanded to 3\u00d73 blocks, preserving pattern.\n- Color 6 (magenta): same behavior \u2014 each pixel becomes a 3\u00d73 magenta block.\n- Color 7 (light blue): same behavior \u2014 scaled to 3\u00d73 blocks.\n\nWhich colors are affected: all nonzero colors {2,4,6,7} are scaled in identical fashion. Which colors stay the same: color identities remain unchanged (no recoloring). No color interactions occur \u2014 colors do not mix or replace each other; they are simply enlarged in place.\n\nCausal reasoning: The purpose is to produce a larger canvas that preserves the original pattern while scaling it uniformly so each original cell maps to a 3\u00d73 tile. This preserves topology and relative positions while enlarging the pattern for easier visual recognition or tiling.\n\nSTEP 4 \u2014 Grid size pattern\n\n- Relationship: outputs are 3\u00d7 larger in each dimension (3 \u2192 9). Equivalently, each dimension is multiplied by 3.\n- Are outputs same size? No, outputs are larger.\n- Why necessary: the rule maps each single input cell to a 3\u00d73 block in the output; thus the full 3\u00d73 input becomes 9\u00d79.\n- Purpose: to create space for the enlarged representation of each input cell and preserve the input pattern at a higher resolution.\n\nSTEP 5 \u2014 General transformation pattern (summary, with WHY)\n\nThe transformation uniformly scales the 3\u00d73 input by a factor of 3 in each direction, producing a 9\u00d79 output: every input cell (whether color 0,2,4,6 or 7) is replaced by a 3\u00d73 block of the same color at coordinates (3r .. 3r+2, 3c .. 3c+2). This preserves the original pattern shape and color identity while enlarging it. The rule applies to any of the nonzero colors (2, 4, 6, 7) and leaves color 0 as background, so the output is a faithful 3\u00d7-scaled version of the input for visualization or tiling purposes.",

In this simple intermediate step I will replicate each input cell's value into its corresponding 3\u00d73 region in the 9\u00d79 grid (0\u2192block of 0s, 2\u2192block of 2s). This shows the cell-to-block mapping clearly and is a minimal change from the empty 9\u00d79.\n\nDescription:\nEXPAND: Take each cell from the 3\u00d73 input and replicate its value into a 3\u00d73 block in the output. For each input cell at (r,c), fill output rows 3r..3r+2 and cols 3c..3c+2 with the same value. This step fills the 9\u00d79 grid with solid 3\u00d73 tiles corresponding to the input values (zeros remain zero tiles, twos become 3\u00d73 blocks of 2s).\n\nGRID:\n[[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2],\n [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2],\n [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2],\n [0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2],\n [0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2]]",
