  "phase1_analysis": "STEP 1: ANALYZE EACH EXAMPLE INDIVIDUALLY\n\nExample 1 (Input → Output, grid 8×9)\n- Input objects (by color):\n  - color 0: background everywhere.\n  - color 8: a single diagonal loop/chain (a 1-pixel-thick ring-like shape) occupying a band across the grid (upper-left to lower-right region).\n- Output objects (by color):\n  - color 0: background everywhere.\n  - color 8: the same diagonal loop/chain in the same location.\n- What changed:\n  - Nothing meaningful changed — the color 8 object remains, same shape and position. No colors were added or removed.\n- What stayed the same:\n  - Grid dimensions (8×9) and the color 8 object’s shape and placement remained identical.\n- Why this change (or lack of change):\n  - Since there is no color 2 object present in this input, nothing gets transformed. The rule only acts on specific colors (see Example 2), so when those colors are absent the grid is left unchanged.\n\nExample 2 (Input → Output, grid 14×9)\n- Input objects (by color):\n  - color 0: background.\n  - color 6: a larger loop/chain near the top of the grid (a 1-pixel-thick ring-like shape).\n  - color 2: a smaller loop/chain near the middle/bottom of the grid (a 1-pixel-thick ring-like shape).\n- Output objects (by color):\n  - color 0: background.\n  - color 6: the same top loop unchanged in shape and position.\n  - color 2: replaced by a canonical hollow square (a 3×3 red ring with a single black pixel center).\n- What changed:\n  - color 6 object is unchanged.\n  - color 2 object is removed and replaced by a 3×3 hollow square (color 2 pixels forming a 3×3 ring with the center pixel color 0).\n- What stayed the same:\n  - Grid dimensions (14×9) and position/shape of the color 6 object.\n- Why this change:\n  - The transformation specifically normalizes any color 2 object into a standardized 3×3 hollow square (with a black center). Other colored objects (color 6, color 8) are left intact.\n\nSTEP 2: COMPARE ACROSS EXAMPLES\n\nInputs — common vs different:\n- Same in all inputs:\n  - color 0 (background) is always present.\n  - At least one loop/chain object is present in every input.\n- Different across inputs:\n  - Which non-background colors appear differs: Example 1 has only color 8; Example 2 has color 6 and color 2.\n  - Object counts and positions vary (Example 2 has two separate colored objects stacked vertically; Example 1 has a single object).\n- Why some things are consistent:\n  - The background (color 0) is always preserved because transformations operate only on specific non-zero colors. The puzzle places loop-like objects but their presence and color can vary.\n\nOutputs — common vs different:\n- Same in all outputs:\n  - Background (color 0) remains.\n  - Non-color-2 objects (colors 6 and 8) remain unchanged in position/shape.\n- Different across outputs:\n  - Only grids that contained color 2 show a change: color 2 objects are replaced by a 3×3 hollow square in the output. Inputs without color 2 remain unchanged.\n- Why the output pattern is consistent:\n  - The rule applies only to color 2 objects: they are converted to the canonical 3×3 hollow-square marker; all other colors are left unchanged.\n\nSTEP 3: IDENTIFY THE TRANSFORMATION PATTERNS (by color)\n\n- Color 0 (background):\n  - Stays the same everywhere. The center of the new 3×3 hollow square is explicitly color 0 (a single black pixel), so color 0 is used to form holes and remains unchanged elsewhere.\n- Color 6:\n  - Stays unchanged (shape and position preserved). In Example 2 the magenta loop is unaffected by the transformation.\n- Color 8:\n  - Stays unchanged (shape and position preserved). In Example 1 the maroon loop is unaffected.\n- Color 2:\n  - Is transformed: any color 2 loop/cluster in the input is replaced by a canonical 3×3 hollow square (a ring of color 2 pixels with a single color 0 pixel in the center).\n  - The new 3×3 ring replaces the original color 2 object while keeping it in approximately the same location (i.e., the transformation normalizes that object to the 3×3 marker centered where the original object was).\n\nWhich colors are affected and why:\n- Only color 2 is actively changed — the rule’s purpose is to standardize/redraw color 2 objects as a simple canonical marker (a 3×3 hollow square). Colors 6 and 8 are not targeted, so they remain unchanged.\n\nCausal reasoning / purpose:\n- The purpose is to replace any instance of color 2 with a compact, standardized marker (3×3 hollow square) while leaving other colored shapes intact. This produces a consistent representation for color 2 objects across different inputs.\n\nSTEP 4: GRID SIZE PATTERN (use given sizes)\n- Given sizes:\n  - Example 1: Input 8×9 → Output 8×9\n  - Example 2: Input 14×9 → Output 14×9\n- Relationship between input and output sizes:\n  - Outputs are the SAME size as inputs in both examples.\n- Why this size relationship:\n  - The transformation is local (it replaces objects in-place with a canonical pattern) and does not require changing the canvas size. Maintaining dimensions preserves the positions of non-target objects and keeps alignment.\n\nSTEP 5: SUMMARY OF THE GENERAL TRANSFORMATION PATTERN (with WHY)\n- The transformation leaves the background (color 0) and any objects of colors 6 or 8 unchanged in place, because the rule only targets color 2. Whenever a color 2 object appears, it is replaced in-place by a canonical 3×3 hollow square of color 2 with a single color 0 center pixel. The purpose is to standardize or mark color 2 objects with a compact marker while preserving all other elements and the original grid size. The underlying rule: \"detect color 2 clusters and replace each with a centered 3×3 color-2 ring (hollow center), leaving other colors and the canvas size unchanged.\"",
  "pattern_summary": "OBJECT INVENTORY (verify first):\nTraining 1 objects:\n- Color 6: multi-cell irregular loop (12 cells). Approximate position: rows 1–5, cols 1–6 (0-based). Irregular closed-chain/loop shape.\n- Color 2: multi-cell irregular cluster (8 cells). Approximate position: rows 7–9, cols 2–5 (0-based). Irregular ring-like cluster / small loop.\nTraining 2 objects:\n- Color 8: multi-cell irregular loop (16 cells). Approximate position: rows 1–5, cols 1–8 (0-based). Irregular closed-chain/loop shape.\nTraining 3 objects:\n- None (only two training examples provided).\n\nUNIVERSAL PATTERN SUMMARY:\nCopy all non-background objects from the input into the output, then mark (highlight) the subset of cells that will remain fixed (anchors). All remaining (non-highlighted) cells are relocated/replaced in a single transformation so the object(s) take the new configuration shown by the examples. Finally restore the highlighted anchor cells to their original colors.\n\nSTEP-BY-STEP PATTERN:\nStep 1: COPY: Copy all objects (every non-background object) from the input into the output at their original positions (preserve shapes and colors).\nStep 2: HIGHLIGHT: Mark the ANCHOR cells that should stay fixed using a temporary color (choose the subset of cells within the copied objects that represent the parts that remain unchanged — typically the larger continuous segments or the majority-preserved portions). These marked cells will stay fixed; all other object cells will be transformed.\nStep 3: TRANSFORM: Move/replace all NON‑highlighted object cells (those not marked with the temporary color) according to the transformation pattern shown in training — i.e., relocate those movable cells so they form the transformed configuration relative to the anchors (apply the same relative shift/replacement rule consistently). Keep the temporary-color anchor cells fixed during this operation.\nStep 4: UN-HIGHLIGHT: Restore all temporary-color anchor cells back to their original colors.\n\nNotes/conditions:\n- If there are multiple objects, apply the same highlight/transform/un-highlight procedure to each object (anchors chosen per object) or to the subset of objects that follow the learned transformation role; if an object is entirely unchanged, its full set of cells will be highlighted and no moves occur for that object.\n- The pattern specifies roles, not specific colors, counts or coordinates: identify which parts stay (anchors) vs which parts move by matching the role/shape behavior from training (majority/continuous parts stay, remaining cells are rearranged).",
