  "phase1_analysis": "STEP 1: Analyze each example individually\n\nExample 1 (input \u2192 output)\n- Input objects:\n  - color 2: a multi-cell irregular blob in the upper-left quadrant.\n  - color 8: a single 1\u00d71 square located to the right and slightly below the blob (separate).\n- Output objects:\n  - color 2: the same multi-cell blob, unchanged in shape and position.\n  - color 8: the single square has moved left/up so it is directly orthogonally adjacent to the color 2 blob (touching its lower-right side).\n- What changed: only the color 8 square moved; color 2 remained the same; background (color 0) unchanged.\n- What stayed the same: dimensions, shape and position of the color 2 object, and there is still exactly one color 8 single cell.\n\nExample 2 (input \u2192 output)\n- Input objects:\n  - color 2: a multi-cell irregular blob near the top-left.\n  - color 8: a single square located well below the blob (same column region but separated vertically).\n- Output objects:\n  - color 2: identical blob, unchanged.\n  - color 8: the single square moved upward until it became directly orthogonally adjacent to the color 2 blob (touching its lower edge).\n- What changed: color 8 translated vertically toward color 2 and stopped when adjacent; color 2 unchanged; background unchanged.\n- What stayed the same: single color 8 cell and the color 2 shape.\n\nExample 3 (input \u2192 output)\n- Input objects:\n  - color 2: a multi-cell irregular blob in the lower-left quadrant.\n  - color 8: a single square located above the blob.\n- Output objects:\n  - color 2: same blob, unchanged.\n  - color 8: the single square moved downward until it became directly orthogonally adjacent to the color 2 blob (touching its upper-right area).\n- What changed: color 8 translated straight toward color 2 and stopped when adjacent; color 2 and background unchanged.\n- What stayed the same: count and shapes of the objects (one multi-cell color 2 blob and one single color 8 cell).\n\nSTEP 2: Compare across examples\n\nInputs \u2014 common vs different:\n- Same in all inputs: each input contains exactly one multi-cell color 2 object and exactly one single-cell color 8 object, plus background color 0.\n- Different between inputs: relative positions vary (color 8 can be to the right, below, or above the color 2 blob). Grid layouts may differ in aspect/placement but each example has the two objects separated initially.\n\nOutputs \u2014 common vs different:\n- Same in all outputs: color 2 is unchanged; color 8 is moved so it becomes orthogonally adjacent to the color 2 blob; background remains color 0. There is still exactly one color 8 cell.\n- Different: the final adjacency occurs on different sides of the color 2 blob depending on the initial relative location of the color 8 cell (right, below, above, etc.).\n\nSTEP 3: Identify the transformation patterns\n\nPer-color behavior:\n- Color 0 (background): remains background everywhere; unchanged.\n- Color 2: does not move or change shape/size between input and output.\n- Color 8: the lone single-cell object is translated in a straight line toward the color 2 blob along the row or column that connects them, and it stops when it becomes orthogonally adjacent (touching) the color 2 object. No rotation, no resizing, and it never overlaps the color 2 cells.\n\nWhich colors are affected:\n- Only color 8 moves. Color 2 and color 0 remain static.\n- There is no color interaction other than adjacency: color 8 moves until it abuts color 2.\n\nSTEP 4: Grid size pattern\n\n- Input sizes: each example\u2019s output grid has the same dimensions as its input grid (the transformation does not change grid size).\n- Output sizes: same as inputs for each corresponding example.\n- Pattern: Output grid = Input grid (no resizing or cropping).\n\nSTEP 5: General transformation pattern (summary)\n\nGeneral pattern (2\u20133 sentences):\n- Each input contains one static multi-cell color 2 blob and one separate single-cell color 8. The single color 8 cell is translated in a straight horizontal or vertical line toward the color 2 blob and stopped when it becomes orthogonally adjacent to the blob. The color 2 shape, background color 0, and grid dimensions remain unchanged.",
