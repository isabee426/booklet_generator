The maroon square is translated from its initial separate location so that it becomes adjacent to the red polyomino and occupies its concave (notched) corner, contacting the red piece on two orthogonal sides.\n- Affected colors: only color 8 is moved. color 2 is not altered. color 0 remains the background.\n- Interaction: color 8 is positioned relative to color 2 (it is moved to fit into color 2's concavity).\n\nSTEP 4: GRID SIZE PATTERN\n\n- Input sizes (HxW):\n  - Ex1: 10 x 10 (as indicated by the sample grid snippet).\n  - Ex2: 10 x 10.\n  - Ex3: 10 x 10.\n- Output sizes:\n  - Ex1 output: 10 x 10 (same as input).\n  - Ex2 output: 10 x 10 (same as input).\n  - Ex3 output: 10 x 10 (same as input).\n- Pattern: Output grid size is the same as the input grid size for each example (no resizing).\n\nSTEP 5: SUMMARY \u2014 GENERAL TRANSFORMATION PATTERN\n\nGeneral pattern (2\u20133 sentences):\n- There are two colored objects: a red polyomino (color 2) with a concave notch and a separate 2x2 maroon square (color 8). In every example, the maroon 2x2 square is translated so that it fills the concave corner of the red polyomino and touches it on two sides; the red polyomino itself is unchanged. The background (color 0) and grid size remain the same.",
