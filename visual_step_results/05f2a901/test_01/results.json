Grid layouts may differ in aspect/placement but each example has the two objects separated initially.\n\nOutputs \u00e2\u20ac\u201d common vs different:\n- Same in all outputs: color 2 is unchanged; color 8 is moved so it becomes orthogonally adjacent to the color 2 blob; background remains color 0. There is still exactly one color 8 cell.\n- Different: the final adjacency occurs on different sides of the color 2 blob depending on the initial relative location of the color 8 cell (right, below, above, etc.).\n\nSTEP 3: Identify the transformation patterns\n\nPer-color behavior:\n- Color 0 (background): remains background everywhere; unchanged.\n- Color 2: does not move or change shape/size between input and output.\n- Color 8: the lone single-cell object is translated in a straight line toward the color 2 blob along the row or column that connects them, and it stops when it becomes orthogonally adjacent (touching) the color 2 object. No rotation, no resizing, and it never overlaps the color 2 cells.\n\nWhich colors are affected:\n- Only color 8 moves. Color 2 and color 0 remain static.\n- There is no color interaction other than adjacency: color 8 moves until it abuts color 2.\n\nSTEP 4: Grid size pattern\n\n- Input sizes: each example\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s output grid has the same dimensions as its input grid (the transformation does not change grid size).\n- Output sizes: same as inputs for each corresponding example.\n- Pattern: Output grid = Input grid (no resizing or cropping).\n\nSTEP 5: General transformation pattern (summary)\n\nGeneral pattern (2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 sentences):\n- Each input contains one static multi-cell color 2 blob and one separate single-cell color 8. The single color 8 cell is translated in a straight horizontal or vertical line toward the color 2 blob and stopped when it becomes orthogonally adjacent to the blob. The color 2 shape, background color 0, and grid dimensions remain unchanged.\n",

Then translate the multi-cell irregular color-2 object (color 2, irregular, original position) in a straight horizontal or vertical line toward the color-8 block and stop when the two objects become orthogonally adjacent (touching but not overlapping). Grid size, object shapes and orientations are preserved.\n\nSTEP-BY-STEP PATTERN:\n\nStep 1: CREATE/NO-OP: Create an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input (background color 0, entire grid).\nStep 2: COPY: Copy the 2\u00d72 block (color 8, 2\u00d72 block, position = as found in input) into the output at the same position (if such a 2\u00d72 color-8 block exists; otherwise do nothing).\nStep 3: COPY: Copy the multi-cell irregular object (color 2, irregular N-cell shape, position = bounding box as found in input) into the output at its original position (if such a color-2 object exists; otherwise do nothing).\nStep 4: MOVE: Move the multi-cell irregular object (color 2, irregular N-cell shape, current position = as copied into output) along the straight line (either along its row or along its column) toward the color-8 block (color 8, 2\u00d72 block, position = as copied) and stop the translation when any cell of the color-2 object becomes orthogonally adjacent to any cell of the color-8 block; preserve the color-2 shape and orientation and do not overlap the color-8 block (if both objects exist; otherwise do nothing).",
