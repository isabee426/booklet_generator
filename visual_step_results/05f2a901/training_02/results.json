  "phase1_analysis": "STEP 1: ANALYZE EACH EXAMPLE INDIVIDUALLY\n\nExample 1 (input \u2192 output)\n- Input objects:\n  - color 2: one irregular L-like cluster located in the upper-left region (touching the top edge).\n  - color 8: one 2x2 solid square located to the right of the color 2 cluster (center-right area).\n- Output objects:\n  - color 2: the same L-like cluster (same shape and orientation).\n  - color 8: the same 2x2 square, now relocated so it is directly adjacent to the color 2 cluster (attached at the cluster's lower-right area).\n- What changed:\n  - color 8 moved from a separate location to touch color 2. color 2 keeps its shape; its location in the output is consistent with being the same object (shape preserved).\n- What stayed the same:\n  - background remains color 0. Both objects preserve shape and color (no recoloring, no resizing).\n\nExample 2 (input \u2192 output)\n- Input objects:\n  - color 2: one irregular L-like cluster in the upper-left.\n  - color 8: one 2x2 square beneath and to the right of the cluster (lower middle area).\n- Output objects:\n  - color 2: same L-like cluster (unchanged shape).\n  - color 8: same 2x2 square moved so it is directly adjacent to the color 2 cluster (attached near the cluster's lower-right).\n- What changed:\n  - color 8 translated to touch color 2. color 2 remains the same shape.\n- What stayed the same:\n  - background color 0 unchanged; number and shapes of colored objects unchanged.\n\nExample 3 (input \u2192 output)\n- Input objects:\n  - color 2: the L-like cluster in the lower-left area.\n  - color 8: a 2x2 square above and slightly right of the cluster (upper-center).\n- Output objects:\n  - color 2: same L-like cluster (shape preserved).\n  - color 8: same 2x2 square moved to become directly adjacent to the color 2 cluster (attached to the cluster's upper-right/top area so they touch).\n- What changed:\n  - color 8 moved to touch color 2. color 2 unchanged in shape.\n- What stayed the same:\n  - background color 0 unchanged; both colored objects preserved.\n\nSTEP 2: COMPARE ACROSS EXAMPLES\n\nInputs \u2014 common vs different\n- SAME in all inputs:\n  - Colors present: color 0 (background), color 2 (one irregular cluster), color 8 (one 2x2 square).\n  - Exactly one color 2 object and one color 8 object in each input.\n- DIFFERENT between inputs:\n  - Relative positions of the two objects vary between examples (color 8 can be above, below, or right of color 2).\n\nOutputs \u2014 common vs different\n- SAME in all outputs:\n  - Colors present remain color 0, color 2, color 8.\n  - color 8 is always placed so that it is directly adjacent (touching) the color 2 cluster.\n  - color 2 keeps the same shape and orientation as in the input.\n- DIFFERENT:\n  - The exact touching position of color 8 relative to the color 2 cluster (which side/top/bottom/right) depends on the initial arrangement so that in each case color 8 ends up adjacent at the nearest convenient location (in these examples it attaches around the cluster's lower-right/upper-right region).\n\nSTEP 3: IDENTIFY THE TRANSFORMATION PATTERNS\n\n- Color 0 (background): stays the background; unchanged.\n- Color 2: object keeps its shape and orientation (no recolor, no reshape). Its position in the output appears consistent with the same object (shape preserved).\n- Color 8: the 2x2 square is translated (moved) from its input location to a new location where it is directly adjacent to the color 2 cluster (touching along an edge/corner area). No resizing or recoloring.\n- Affected colors: only color 8 is actively moved. color 2 is preserved (not altered in shape), and color 0 stays the same background.\n- Interaction: color 8 is moved so that it contacts color 2 (becomes attached to the color 2 cluster).\n\nSTEP 4: GRID SIZE PATTERN\n\n- Input sizes: Ex1: 10x10, Ex2: 10x10, Ex3: 10x10 (all examples use the same grid size).\n- Output sizes: Ex1: 10x10, Ex2: 10x10, Ex3: 10x10 (unchanged).\n- Pattern: Output grid size is the same as the input grid size.\n\nSTEP 5: SUMMARY OF THE GENERAL TRANSFORMATION PATTERN\n\nGeneral pattern (2\u20133 sentences):\n- Each input contains one irregular color 2 cluster and one color 8 2x2 square on a color 0 background. The transformation moves the color 8 square so that it becomes directly adjacent to (touches) the color 2 cluster; the color 2 shape and color 0 background remain unchanged. The color 8 square is translated to an adjacent position next to color 2 without resizing or recoloring.\n\nSTEP 6: VARIABLE STEP COUNTS\n- Not applicable \u2014 the examples show the same single transformation in each case.",
