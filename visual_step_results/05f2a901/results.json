  "phase1_analysis": "STEP 1: ANALYZE EACH EXAMPLE INDIVIDUALLY\n\nExample 1 (input \u2192 output)\n- Input objects:\n  - color 2: one irregular multi-cell blob in the upper-left quadrant (an L-like / blocky shape).\n  - color 8: one 2x2 solid square located to the right of the color 2 blob (in the mid-right area).\n- Output objects:\n  - color 2: the same irregular blob (shape preserved).\n  - color 8: the same 2x2 square, now positioned immediately adjacent to the color 2 blob (touching it).\n- What changed:\n  - color 8 moved from its original location to a new location where it contacts the color 2 blob.\n- What stayed the same:\n  - color 2 blob shape and orientation unchanged.\n  - color 8 size and shape unchanged.\n  - background (color 0) remains.\n\nExample 2 (input \u2192 output)\n- Input objects:\n  - color 2: one irregular multi-cell blob near the top-left area (similar blocky L shape).\n  - color 8: one 2x2 solid square located lower and to the right of the color 2 blob.\n- Output objects:\n  - color 2: same irregular blob, unchanged.\n  - color 8: same 2x2 square moved so that it now touches the color 2 blob (adjacent).\n- What changed:\n  - color 8 moved to contact color 2.\n- What stayed the same:\n  - color 2 preserved.\n  - color 8 preserved in shape/size.\n  - background unchanged.\n\nExample 3 (input \u2192 output)\n- Input objects:\n  - color 2: one irregular multi-cell blob in the lower-left quadrant.\n  - color 8: one 2x2 solid square located above the color 2 blob (upper-middle).\n- Output objects:\n  - color 2: same irregular blob, unchanged.\n  - color 8: the 2x2 square moved down to be directly adjacent (touching) the color 2 blob.\n- What changed:\n  - color 8 moved to a position adjacent to color 2.\n- What stayed the same:\n  - color 2 unchanged in shape and location.\n  - color 8 unchanged except for translation.\n  - background unchanged.\n\nSTEP 2: COMPARE ACROSS EXAMPLES\n\nInputs \u2014 common vs different:\n- Same in all inputs:\n  - The same set of colors: color 2 (one irregular multi-cell object) and color 8 (one 2x2 square), on a color 0 background.\n  - Exactly one color 2 object and one color 8 object present.\n- Different between inputs:\n  - Relative positions of the two objects vary (color 8 can be to the right, below, or above color 2).\n  - Canvas aspect may vary visually, but each input contains the two objects in different relative placements.\n\nOutputs \u2014 common vs different:\n- Same in all outputs:\n  - Both colors remain present (color 2 and color 8).\n  - color 2 is unchanged; color 8 has been translated so it is adjacent to/touching color 2.\n  - color 8 remains a 2x2 square.\n- Different between outputs:\n  - The exact contact location (which side of color 2 the color 8 square touches) differs according to the initial arrangement; it always moves to the nearest contacting position.\n\nSTEP 3: IDENTIFY THE TRANSFORMATION PATTERNS\n\n- Color 0 (background): stays the same everywhere; unchanged.\n- Color 2: the irregular multi-cell object is not altered \u2014 same shape and same location in the output.\n- Color 8: the 2x2 square is translated (moved) so that it becomes adjacent to (touches) the color 2 object. Its shape and orientation are preserved; only its position changes.\n\nWhich colors are affected:\n- Only color 8 is moved. Color 2 and color 0 remain unchanged.\n\nDo any colors interact:\n- The interaction is positional: color 8 is moved until it contacts color 2. There is no change to color 2\u2019s pixels, and color 8 does not change shape or orientation.\n\nSTEP 4: GRID SIZE PATTERN\n\n- Input sizes (observed examples): Ex1: 9x9, Ex2: 9x9, Ex3: 9x9 (all examples use the same grid size).\n- Output sizes: Ex1: 9x9, Ex2: 9x9, Ex3: 9x9 (outputs keep the same grid size).\n- Pattern: Output grid size equals input grid size; only object positions change.\n\nSTEP 5: SUMMARIZE THE GENERAL TRANSFORMATION PATTERN\n\nGeneral rule (2\u20133 sentences):\n- There are two objects: an irregular color 2 blob and a 2x2 color 8 square on a color 0 background. The transformation moves the color 8 square (without changing its shape) to the nearest position where it contacts (is adjacent to) the color 2 object. Color 2 and the background (color 0) remain unchanged, and the grid size is preserved.",
